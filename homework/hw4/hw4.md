Problems 4: competition

1. Hastings Problems 7.1, 7.2, 7.4
2. Suppose you are awarded research funding to study the outcomes of interactions between two species for 20 days, `t = 1:20`, whose dynamics are well-described by a Lotka-Volterra competition model. Species 1 changes according to `r1 = 0.1, K1 = 2` and Species 2 changes according to `r2 = 0.6, K2 = 1`. Moreover, the effect of Species 2 on the growth rate of Species 1 `a12 = 0.15` and the effect of 1 on 2 `a21 = 0.3`. Assume initial conditions for both species are identical and equal to `0.1`. Plot the system's dynamics, including `ylim = c(0, 2)` as an argument in your `plot()` function so that both species fit on a single plot. What would be the conclusion from this experiment? Suppose you got funding to perform the same study for 100 days `t = 1:100`. Would your conclusions be the same? Why should short- and longer-term ecological experiments be interpereted in different ways?
3. Review the ideas fellow classmates submitted in HW3 for team teaching and the wiki-a-thon.  Choose a topic you'd like to contribute to.  Or, if you did not submit a topic last week, do so now (include a link to google docs that you make open so that everyone with the edit can view).
