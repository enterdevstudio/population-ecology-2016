# Population Ecology
BI 471/571:  Population Ecology     	
Spring 2016

### Homework 3

1. Hastings Problems `6.1`, `6.3`.

2. In class we went through equilibrium and stability analysis for two species, following the notation in Hastings `Box 6.1`.  We then began discussing a two-species competition model, following the notation in Hastings Chapter 7. Both discussions use the notation ùû™ij, but in each case ùû™ij means something different. Explain how ùû™ij differs between Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 of Hastings. Propose a different notation that would improve the book.  For those who opt-in, we will send your ideas to Alan Hastings.

3. Work through this interactive demo on [eigenvalues](http://setosa.io/ev/eigenvectors-and-eigenvalues/). In the model under the section marked `Steady States`, what is ultimate result of increasing the `p` parameter?

4. Assemble a 1-page ‚Äúpitch‚Äù for a population ecology topic that you would be enthusiastic to learn about, teach, and generate wikipedia content on.  Assemble your pitch in an openly accessible Google Doc, and provide the link. Pitches will be shared with the entire class. After reading through all of the pitches, students will get to select a topic. Students will have the opportunity to work solo or to work in groups/teams on a topic.  Detailed information about the wiki-a-thon and team-teaching will be provided in class on May 6.
 
Your pitch should include the following: 

++Topic area.  Projects can focus on any current topic relevant to population ecology. Example topic areas are located in the syllabus.

++Example readings/videos, chosen with the following goals: 1) concise, 2) published in a reputable venue within the past 24 months, 4) relevant to the main points you want to convey in class. Choose at least one reading, and no more than 2 readings/videos total.

++Content outline describing: what are the 3 main messages you want to convey?
