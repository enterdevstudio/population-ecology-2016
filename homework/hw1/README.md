### Homework 1

In general in R, we perform an action, and take the results of that action and
assign the results to a new object, thereby creating a new object. Here I add
two numbers and assign the result to an new object I call *a*.

```r
a <- 2 + 3
a
```
Use an arrow to make the assignment with a
less-than sign, <, and a dash. Note also that to reveal the contents of the object,
you can type the name of the object.

You can then use the new object to perform another action, and assign:

```r
b <- a + a
```

You can also perform multiple actions on the same line by using a semicolon

```r
a + a; a + b
```
